 # The progress of the home task 8

 ## 1
Writing an easy program, which displays current date and time

#### The code: 
```python
   from datetime import datetime

   print("Today is", (datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y")))
   print("Current time is", (datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")))
```
#### The output:

 ## 2
Writing a python program, which accepts comma-separated numbers, and then writes tuple and list of them

#### The code:
```python
numbers = input("Please enter some comma-separated numbers here: ")
list = numbers.split(",")
tuple = tuple(list)
print("List: ",list)
print("Tuple: ",tuple)
```
#### The output:

 ## 3
Writing python program, which asks file name, then reads the file and displays only even lines

#### The code:
```python
file = input("Please enter file name here: ")
i = 1
f = open(file, 'r')
for line in f.readlines():
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(line)
    i += 1
else:
    pass
f.close()
```
#### The output:

 ## 4
Writing python program, which reads html document, parses it, and shows itâ€™s title

#### The code:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
with open(input("Please enter here name of the file to parse: ")) as obj:
    data = BeautifulSoup(obj, "html.parser")
    print("TITLE is: ", (data.title.text))
obj.close()
```

 ## 5
Writing python program, which parses userâ€™s text and replaces some emotions with emojiâ€™s

#### The code:
```python
text = input("Pls input your text with emotions: ")
words = text.split(" ")
emojis = {
   "smiling" : "\U0001F642",
   "disappointed" : "\U0001F61E",
   "grinning" : "\U0001F600",
   "fearful":"\U0001F628",
   "happy": "\U0001F973",
   "laughing": "\U0001F923"
}
output = " "
for word in words:
   output += emojis.get(word, word) + " "
print(output)
```
#### Text for the input:  

I was standing smiling but a bit disappointed while John approached to me with his grinning face making me fearful. But eventually I noticed he had forgotten his gun. It made me happy and I burst out laughing loudly.

#### The output:

I was standing ðŸ™‚ but a bit ðŸ˜ž while John approached to me with his ðŸ˜€ face making me fearful. But eventually I noticed he had forgotten his gun. It made me ðŸ¥³ and I burst out ðŸ¤£ loudly.

 ## 6
Writing a program, that shows basic PC information

#### The code:
```python

    Scale bytes to its proper format

print(f"Total CPU Usage: {psutil.cpu_percent()}%")

# Disk Information
print("="*40, "Disk Information", "="*40)
print("Partitions and Usage:")

for partition in partitions:
    print(f"=== Device: {partition.device} ===")
    print(f"  Mountpoint: {partition.mountpoint}")
    print(f"  File system type: {partition.fstype}")
    try:

    except PermissionError:

        # isn't ready
        continue
    print(f"  Total Size: {get_size(partition_usage.total)}")
    print(f"  Used: {get_size(partition_usage.used)}")
    print(f"  Free: {get_size(partition_usage.free)}")
    print(f"  Percentage: {partition_usage.percent}%")

disk_io = psutil.disk_io_counters()
print(f"Total read: {get_size(disk_io.read_bytes)}")
print(f"Total write: {get_size(disk_io.write_bytes)}")
```
